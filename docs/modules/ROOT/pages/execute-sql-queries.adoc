= Executing SQL Queries
:description: You can open a SQL shell in your cluster and submit SQL queries directly from a web browser.

{description}

Before you can start querying data, you must do the following:

* If your data is in an existing map on the cluster, create a mapping to it first. To do this, either execute a xref:hazelcast:sql:create-mapping.adoc[`CREATE MAPPING` statement], or use the xref:connector-wizard.adoc[connector wizard].   
* If your data is in an external system, you can create a data connection to it. To do this, either execute a xref:hazelcast:sql:create-data-connection.adoc[`CREATE DATA CONNECTION` statement], or use the xref:connector-wizard.adoc[connector wizard].

== Executing Your First Query

To submit a SQL query:

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank] and select your cluster.
. Go to *SQL*.
. Click *Compose New Query*.
. Enter your SQL query and execute it.

Your query syntax is saved, and any data resources accessed via mappings or data connections are added to the Data Explorer for future use.
