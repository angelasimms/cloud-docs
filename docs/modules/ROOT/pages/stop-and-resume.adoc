== Pausing a Cluster

Pausing your cluster can help minimize your costs because you are charged only for running clusters. Development clusters are paused automatically when you don't connect to the cluster for 24 hours. 

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank] and select your cluster.
. Click *Pause* and confirm your choice.

If you're using a {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless production cluster, Hazelcast saves your cluster data so that you can resume the cluster at a later time.

.What is cluster data?

== Resuming a Cluster

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank] and select your cluster.
. Click *Resume*.
