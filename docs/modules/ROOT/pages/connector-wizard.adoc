{description}

The connector wizard helps you to set up, test, and save a secure data connection to a data source or sink from a {hazelcast-cloud} cluster. It also guides you through the process of creating a mapping to selected data resources. The mapping allows you to query any of the selected data using SQL.

From the connector wizard, you can also add mappings to existing data connections and run guided demos.

== Supported Connections

The connector wizard currently supports connections to the following platforms:

* xref:kafka-connections.adoc[Kafka]
* xref:postgres-connections.adoc[PostgreSQL]
* xref:imap-connections.adoc[Hazelcast IMap] - This connector makes it easier to create mappings to IMaps already  written to a {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

You can also set up your own data connections to the following platforms in SQL or programmatically:

* xref:hazelcast:data-connections:data-connections-configuration.adoc#JDBC[MySQL using a JDBC connection]
* xref:hazelcast:data-connections:data-connections-configuration.adoc#Mongo[MongoDB]
