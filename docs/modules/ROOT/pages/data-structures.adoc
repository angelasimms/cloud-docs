[WARNING]
.Heap memory limits
====
{hazelcast-cloud} Serverless clusters have the following heap memory limits:

* Production clusters: 1 GB memory per cluster member
* Development clusters: 300 MB per cluster

Exceeding these limits can lead to cluster failure. 

Be aware that the following operations use heap memory: writing, caching, or replicating data to data structures other than IMap an JCache. 

See xref:serverless-cluster.adoc#heap-memory-limits-of-viridian-serverless-clusters[Heap Memory Limits of {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless Clusters] for further details.
