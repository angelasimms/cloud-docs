:description: You can restrict access to your cluster to allow only authorized clients to connect to it.

{description}

== {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless

If you're using a {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless cluster, you can add your client IP addresses to a xref:ip-white-list.adoc[whitelist].

== {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated

If you're using a {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated cluster, you must authorize your clients to connect to your cluster. {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated clusters are private by default to prevent attacks such as denial of service. To authorize clients, you can do the following add client IP addresses to a xref:ip-white-list.adoc[whitelist].

TIP: You must use VPC peering if your clients' IP addresses are not static or if you want to limit your cluster's exposure to the public Internet.
