== {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless

If you're using a {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless cluster, you can add your client IP addresses to a xref:ip-white-list.adoc[whitelist].

== {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated

 {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated clusters are private by default to prevent attacks such as denial of service. To authorize clients to connect to your clusters, you must use VPC peering. Contact the support team for full details.
