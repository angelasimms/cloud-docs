== Before you Begin

You need a xref:create-account.adoc[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} account].

To create more than one cluster, you must add a xref:payment-methods.adoc[payment card] to your account.

== Using the Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} Console

[tabs]

Development cluster::

To create a development cluster, do the following:

// tag::development[]
. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank].
. Click *Create New Cluster*.
. Click *Create Development Cluster*.
. Update the cluster name if you want to. You cannot change the cluster name after the cluster is created.
. Click *Create Cluster*. 
. Wait while your cluster is created. When the cluster is up and running, a *Quick Connection Guide* is displayed with instructions for connecting a sample client to it.
// end::development[]
--
NOTE: Development clusters are xref:stop-and-resume.adoc#pausing-a-cluster[paused] automatically when you don't connect to the cluster for 6 hours. 

Production cluster::

To create a production cluster, do the following:

// tag::production[]
. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console, window=blank].
. Click *Create New Cluster*.
. Click *Create Production Cluster*.
. Update the cluster name if you want to. You cannot change the cluster name after the cluster is created.
. Click *Create Cluster*
. Wait while your cluster is created. When the cluster is up and running, a *Quick Connection Guide* is displayed with instructions for connecting a sample client to it.
// end::production[]

NOTE: Production clusters are xref:stop-and-resume.adoc#pausing-a-cluster[paused] automatically if you don't have a payment method set up _and_ you don't connect to your cluster for 24 hours.
